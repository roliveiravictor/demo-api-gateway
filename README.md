### Notes ###

   *  1. Generated iOS Sample doest no require to explicitly call ASyncTask such as in Android

   *  2. Provided iOS Sample comes with an Error inside PETPet Model. Id field is given as String when in fact it should be a NSNumber. This causes the entire application to crash when requesting a specific pet with 'client.petsPetIdGet'.

### Prints ###

   *  N/A
